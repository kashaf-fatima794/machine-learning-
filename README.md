## 1.  TV Ad Budget vs Sales Prediction

This project uses **Linear Regression** to analyze and predict product sales based on the TV advertising budget.

###  Key Features
* **Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib to plot trends and inspect data distribution.
* **Train-Test Split**: Dynamically splits data into **80% Training** and **20% Testing** sets.
* **Accuracy Evaluation**: Calculates the $R^2$ accuracy score to evaluate model performance.

###  Setup & Run
* **Dataset**: Requires a file named `data.csv`.
* **Execution**: Run the script to predict sales for budgets like `$50`, `$100`, and `$200`.

## 2.  Coffee Shop Sales Prediction

A project focusing on predicting a coffee shop's **Daily Sales ($)** based on operational features (like customer count) using multiple regression models.

###  Key Features
* **Feature Scaling**: Implements `StandardScaler` to normalize features for better optimization.
* **Multi-Model Training**: Fits and compares both **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** and **Linear Regression**.
* **Live Prediction Pipeline**: Scales new user inputs on the fly for instant sales estimates.

###  Setup & Run
* **Dataset**: Requires `coffee_shop_sales.csv`.
* **Execution**: Pass an input (e.g., `[200]` customers) to get the predicted daily sales.

## 3.  Customer Purchase Prediction

A classification project using the **Gaussian Naive Bayes** algorithm to predict customer purchasing behavior based on demographics.

###  Key Features
* **Data Cleaning**: Automatically handles missing data points using `dropna()`.
* **Label Encoding**: Transforms categorical text (Gender, Income, etc.) into numeric values via `LabelEncoder`.
* **Probabilistic Modeling**: Uses `GaussianNB` to classify whether a customer will make a purchase.

###  Setup & Run
* **Dataset**: Requires `new_dataset_1000.csv`.
* **Execution**: Pass encoded customer profiles (e.g., `[[1, 0, 2, 1]]`) to get a `Yes/No` prediction.
